# react-todo-app

A simple todo list app built with react js and bootstrap css

The user has the ability to change the status of a `todo list item`, as well as add a new `todo list item`. The `todo list` is pre-populated with data.

### TODOs:

- Make selection box text dynamic based on encapsulating `todo list item`'s `status`
- Add the ability for the user to delete `todo list item`'s
- Add categorisation of `todo list item`'s with the ability of user to select a category for filtering
- Add backend services (database, API)
